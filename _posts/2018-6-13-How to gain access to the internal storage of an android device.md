Well for starters, this is my first blog post ever and I am really excited about it.  

In this blog, I will primarily solve problems/state about new technologies in a layman's tongue so that beginners can get benefitted the most from it.  

Without much ado, lets state the solution.  

After using Google umpteen times, I was unable to find a proper solution to this problem. For Android developers this can be easily solved.
Here are the steps invloved :

1. Connect your Android device to your *laptop/desktop* via the *usb* port.  

2. Fire up *Android Studio* (which must be installed if you are a developer).  

3. On the **RIGHT hand** panel you will see a *Device Explorer* tab. Click on it.

4. Select your device from a *drop down* from the panel that appears.  

5. Awesome! You can now gain access to the **INTERNAL STORAGE** of your Android device!. By access I mean *read/write/delete* access.

6. Navigate into the *folder* where you want to store/ from where you want to fetch files. Typically the **STORAGE** folder contains your *SD card and APP data*.  

7. Upon finding your *file/folder* you can **RIGHT CLICK** on it to **OPEN**, **SAVE AS**(alternative to copy/paste) or **DELETE** the file.

8. To **UPLOAD**(alternative to paste) a *file/folder* into the Internal storage, again **RIGHT CLICK** on the specific folder and choose **UPLOAD** option.  

   ![paste_options]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-06-13/paste_options.png)  

9. A window will now open where you can navigate to the appropriate *file/folder* that you want to **UPLOAD** and click on OK.
